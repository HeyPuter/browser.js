/**
 * The text layer: text, and the source of a script or style element.
 *
 * A script element's children are its program and a style element's are its
 * stylesheet, so both go through a rewriter on the way in and have to come back
 * out unrewritten. Everything else in the tree is text like any other.
 *
 * The model is one string per element - its "child text content", the
 * concatenation of its Text children - held two ways at once:
 *
 *   - what the page wrote, per node, in `box.characterDataSources` (and, for a
 *     script, in the `scramjet-attr-script-source-src` attribute, which is
 *     where the HTML rewriter leaves it and which survives cloning)
 *   - what the document holds, which is the rewritten whole in the *first* Text
 *     child with every later one emptied, so that the browser's own
 *     concatenation is exactly the rewritten program
 *
 * Every member that can change that text - `textContent`, `innerText`,
 * `script.text`, the `CharacterData` mutators, and every insertion method that
 * can put a Text node under a script - re-derives the first from its parts and
 * rewrites it whole. Rewriting a fragment on its own is not an option: half a
 * program does not parse, and the half that does would run unrewritten.
 *
 * The order matters as much as the content. A connected script that has not
 * executed yet is prepared - and runs - the moment its children change
 * (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#script-children-changed-steps),
 * so nothing may reach the DOM before it has been through the rewriter. That is
 * why an insertion blanks the text it is inserting, inserts it, and only then
 * writes the rewritten whole.
 *
 * The interceptors that use this live in `dom/node.ts`, `dom/markup.ts` (a
 * script's `innerHTML` is its source) and `dom/fragments.ts` (ranges).
