 * How a stack frame is traced back to the script that owns it, which is what

 *
 * - `pst`   `Error.prepareStackTrace` plus `CallSite.getScriptHash`, both V8
 *           only. Costs nothing observable: the hash is already on every
 *           frame, eval'd ones included, and is not part of what a page reads.
 * - `stamp` Every call in a rewritten script goes through `callfn`, which
 *           records the calling script's realm for the length of the call.
 *           Reads no stack and shows the page nothing, at the cost of a call
 *           through a function for every call the page makes.
 * - `lazystamp`
 *           `stamp`, narrowed at rewrite time to the calls that look like they
 *           need attributing. Cheap enough to be what the default flags pick
 *           off V8, where `pst` has nothing to read. Misses a call reached
 *           through a reference the rewriter could not recognise, such as a
 *           bound one.
 * - `none`  No attribution.
 *
 * Nothing substitutes one mode for another at use time: the default flags
 * choose one the engine can do, and a mode set by hand is used as given.

/**
 * How the incumbent is found when no script of the page's is running - a
 * callback the host invoked, which HTML answers from the backup incumbent
 * settings object stack.
 * https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#backup-incumbent-settings-object-stack
 *
 * - `full`  Every Web IDL member that takes a callback captures the incumbent
 *           when it converts one, and the callback runs with it pushed. The
 *           members are expanded from the IDL at build time; see
 *           `client/shared/callbacks.ts`. Costs a patch per member and a
 *           stack read per conversion.
 * - `bind`  Only a bound incumbent-sensitive member carries an entry, the
 *           incumbent of whoever bound it - which is the realm that converts
 *           it, unless one realm binds and another hands it over. One hook,
 *           on `Function.prototype.bind`.
 * - `none`  Nothing is recorded, and a callback with no script of its own
 *           answers with the realm whose member is being called.
